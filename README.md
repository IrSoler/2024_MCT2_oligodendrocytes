Welcome to the repository for the manuscript entitled **Monocarboxylate transporter 2 is required for the maintenance of myelin and axonal integrity by oligodendrocytes** (Izaguirre-Urizar *et al.*). This repository contains the step-by-step scripts developed for the bioinformatic analyses (In silico analyses of Slc16a7 and Slc16a1 expression section). 

Structure:

- 01_processing.R: code mostly intended to perform i) quality control and filtering, 2) normalization and 3) oligodendrocyte subsetting.

- 02_differential_gene_expression: code intended to perform differential expression analysis for Slc16a7 and Slc16a1 genes in the conditions of interest (e.g. multiple sclerosis vs. controls).

- 03_visualization.R: code to generate the graphical representations of the manuscript.
